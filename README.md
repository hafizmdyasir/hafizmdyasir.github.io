This is my profile page that links to my social profiles and showcases my apps and books. In time, I am hoping for it to evolve into a proper website but for now, it serves the purposes I seek.

The page consists of the following four sections:
### 1. Intro
Short introduction to myself and my works.

### 2. Apps
Showcases the apps I have built. Note that I did not include the libraries I created for Android app development since they are available anyway on GitHub. Perhaps some of my apps in the future might not be open-source and thus, they deserve a separate section more than libraries do.
My application related work will be moved later on to a separate website and this section will just serve as an "interface" between the two.

### 3. Books
What is an author without his books? The books I publish will find their way here. Once again, once the list grows expansive, I will adjust this section since the profile page has to be short, simple, and lightweight.

### 4. Links
Naturally, a profile page isn't complete without links to my profiles and other portals. This section serves that purpose.

>This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages" and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect. Hope you dig it :)
